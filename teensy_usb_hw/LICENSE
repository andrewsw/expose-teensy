The files in this directory are provided under a simple permissive
license as listed in the header of each file. This license is
ambiguous in terms of whether is it compatible with GPL v2 as the rest
of the software in the teensy driver. But the software in this
directory is not linked against any of the software that is licensed
under the GPL, and is in intended to run on a separate device. We
think that this does not cause a license conflict. 

We hope to make the license consistent across this project in the
future, but cannot guarantee that this will happen. 

The licenses for each file in this directory are included in the files
directly.
