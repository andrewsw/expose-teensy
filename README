This is a class project for cs572, Fall 2010 at Portland State University.

The objective is to develop a general purpose driver for the teensy micro-controller
that exposes a series of abstract character devices in userland. These devices
will control various aspects of the teensy for a variety of purposes. The idea is
that a simple set of ioctls, along with reads and writes can provide general purpose
functionality without fiddly access to the teensy directly.
